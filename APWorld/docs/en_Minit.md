# Minit

## Where is the options page?

The [player options page for Minit](../player-options) contains all the options you need to configure and export a config file.

## What is the goal of Minit when randomized?

Same as vanilla; Either break the Sword Machine and beat the boss, or aquire the broken sword and flush it down the Factory toilet.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

All items in Minit are added to the multiworld item pool. This includes the held items (the Watering Can and the Broken, Basic, and Mega Swords), the key items (Gardening Glove, Grinder, etc.), all collectables (Coins, Tentacles), and health upgrades.

## What is considered a location check in Minit?

Location checks in Minit are all of the key items' original pickup locations, all coins, hearts, and tentacles are Location checks as well. Note all of the locations have to be picked up with their vanilla methodologies (i.e. coin chests need to be hit with a sword or watering can, all tentacles need to be hit with the sword strike or throw, all quests need to be completed to spawn their relevant items).

## Which notable items are not randomized?

The Bone in the graveyard, and the hotel residents are not randomized.

## What does another world's item look like in Minit?

Item locations have their original sprites.

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

Items will not be added synchronously to the player's inventory, rather the player is expected to pick up an item with the Archipelago logo as a sprite that is spawned near their current home base to manually sync all received items.

## What are recommended options to tweak for beginners to the rando?

Vanilla Sword is recommended to turn on for beginners as it opens up many more checks in early game and removes potential requirements for the player to use unintuitive pathing and interactions.
Also Goal: Flush is a much quicker goal to use as it only requires Factory access and the item Broken Sword.

## What is different from the vanilla game?

* There is an extra location available: you can water the Dolphin NPC south of the Watering Can vanilla location to spawn a heart.
* Regardless of mode both Camera and PressPass will be treated as the same Location, but only PressPass is in the item pool.
* The camera pickup location near your current House is an AP Item that will sync your inventory with the remote server.
* If you have received a remote item from the Archipelago Server, it does not sync automatically into your inventory. You are expected to sync your inventory with the AP Item near the house. Local items will automatically be added to your inventory though.
* An extra keybind has been added (currently only on keyboard Q) to respawn at the Start Location.
